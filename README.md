1. Ensure an entry is available for fetching. Start sails and navigate to http://localhost:1337/mymodel/create?name=something
2. CD into the backbone folder and run `http-server` to start it on localhost:8080
3. Navigate to localhost:8080 and monitor the browser log....

Currently getting
XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:1337/mymodel/. The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header contains the invalid value ''. Origin 'http://localhost:8080' is therefore not allowed access.
